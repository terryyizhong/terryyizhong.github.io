I work at Tencent AI Lab, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Center as a senior research engineer now, doing some speech-related applied research. 

I am also about to become a visiting researcher at the [Audio Information Research(AIR) Lab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9jrmcG4AAAAJ&hl=en/) of Rochester, advised by Professor [Zhiyao Duan](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/).

My research interest includes Speech Synthesis, Music Generation and Transcription, and other Computer Audition topics.
